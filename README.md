# Odin Project - Project: Rock Paper Scissors
This project is part of the Odin Project's curriculum.

It is meant to showcase my skill with javascript, DOM manipulation and previous skills.

~~It is console only. It simulates game of rps by taking prompt from user and generating a computer choice. Then it evaluates the choices and assigns points. Game is five rounds long.~~

After the update Game is fully playable in browser. You can play basic rock, paper, scissors against computer. Who reaches 5 wins first wins and game resets. You can also reset the game yourself at any point with a button.
